# TV Streaming Backend Application: Project Plan

## 1. Project Overview

This document outlines the high-level plan for developing the TV Streaming Backend Application. The project's primary goal is to serve as a **technology demonstrator**, showcasing a robust, scalable, and modular backend built on a microservices architecture using FastAPI and Python. Key features include comprehensive content management, user and authentication systems, flexible rights management (SVOD, TVOD), and a low-latency global search.

## 2. Goals

* Develop a functional TV Streaming backend based on a microservices architecture.
* Demonstrate clear separation of concerns with independent FastAPI services.
* Implement a centralized API Gateway for routing, authentication, and authorization.
* Achieve low-latency global search across all metadata.
* Utilize Docker and Docker Compose for containerization and local orchestration.
* Establish efficient Python dependency management with `uv`.
* Provide a foundation for future expansion into a full-scale product.

## 3. Key Design Decisions Recap

This section provides a brief overview of key design decisions. For comprehensive design details, including architecture diagrams and technology stack, please refer to the [DESIGNDOCUMENT.md](./DESIGNDOCUMENT.md) file. Complete API endpoint specifications and documentation can be found in [APIENDPOINTS.md](./APIENDPOINTS.md). Detailed API Gateway design, including internal mechanisms and code samples, is available in [APIGATEWAY.md](./APIGATEWAY.md).

* **Architecture:** Microservices design pattern.
* **Backend Framework:** FastAPI (Python) for all microservices and the API Gateway.
* **Service Granularity:** Each core module (User Management, Authentication, On-Demand, Live TV, Rights Management, Global Search, API Gateway) will be an independent FastAPI application running in its own Docker container.
* **Inter-Service Communication:** Primarily RESTful HTTP/HTTPS API calls. Asynchronous communication via message queues (e.g., Redis/Celery) for non-critical updates like search indexing.
* **Containerization:** Docker for services, Docker Compose for local development orchestration.
* **Independent Service Management:** Docker Compose allows building/restarting individual services without affecting others.
* **Python Dependency Management:** `uv` from Astral for fast and reliable package management; each service will have its own `pyproject.toml`.
* **Repository Setup:** Single Repository (Monorepo) for simplified development, coordination, and CI/CD for the demonstrator phase.
* **Database Strategy:** Shared PostgreSQL instance for all microservices, with each service managing its own dedicated tables/schema.
* **Global Search:** Dedicated Global Search Service leveraging Elasticsearch/OpenSearch for indexing and querying metadata.
* **API Endpoint Separation:** API Gateway enforces logical separation (`/client` vs. `/admin` prefixes) and strong RBAC for admin endpoints.

## 4. Development Phases

The project will proceed through the following logical phases:

### Phase 1: Infrastructure & Core Setup
* Establish the monorepo structure.
* Set up Docker Compose for core infrastructure services (PostgreSQL, Redis, Elasticsearch).
* Implement the base `Dockerfile` and `pyproject.toml` for FastAPI services.
* Develop the initial API Gateway skeleton.

### Phase 2: Core Microservices Development (Iterative)
* Develop each microservice (User Management, Authentication, On-Demand, Live TV, Rights Management, Global Search) as an independent unit.
* Focus on implementing core CRUD operations and business logic for each service.
* Implement inter-service communication where necessary.

### Phase 3: API Gateway & Integration
* Implement comprehensive routing logic in the API Gateway.
* Integrate centralized authentication and authorization (JWT validation, RBAC enforcement).
* Ensure seamless data flow between clients -> Gateway -> Microservices.
* Follow the detailed API endpoint specifications and documentation in [APIENDPOINTS.md](./APIENDPOINTS.md).
* Refer to [APIGATEWAY.md](./APIGATEWAY.md) for detailed design and implementation of the API Gateway, including code samples and configuration.

### Phase 4: Global Search & Asynchronous Processing
* Build the Global Search Service's full functionality (FastAPI endpoint, Elasticsearch integration).
* Implement asynchronous indexing mechanisms (e.g., Celery workers with Redis) for real-time metadata updates to the search index.

### Phase 5: Cross-Cutting Concerns & Quality Assurance
* Implement robust error handling and logging across all services.
* Develop comprehensive unit and integration tests for each microservice and the API Gateway.
* Refine security measures (e.g., environment variable loading, secret management placeholders).

### Phase 6: Frontend Demonstrator & End-to-End Testing
* Develop a basic frontend application (e.g., React) to consume the client-facing APIs.
* Perform end-to-end testing of the entire stack, from frontend to backend services.
* Demonstrate key use cases (user registration, login, content browsing, playback, search).

## 5. Team & Workflow

* **Team:** (Assumed a small, collaborative team for a demonstrator).
* **Collaboration:** Git for version control, mandatory code reviews.
* **Local Development:** VS Code with recommended extensions (Python, Docker, Remote - Containers) and `uv` for consistent environments.
* **CI/CD:** Basic CI/CD pipeline for automated builds and tests (can be expanded later).

## 6. Future Considerations (Beyond Demonstrator)

* Advanced API Gateway features (request/response transformation, circuit breaking).
* Distributed tracing for microservices.
* More robust logging and monitoring solutions.
* Horizontal scaling strategies for production deployment (Kubernetes).
* Dedicated DevOps for CI/CD and infrastructure management.
* Full client-side application development.

This plan provides a structured approach to building a robust TV Streaming Backend Demonstrator, laying a strong foundation for future development.
